# BookEnds  

A p5.js script that cycles through a series photographs. Used as inveractive cover art for a demo EP. With some refinement could be used to emulate flipbook style animation.   To view the script running go to [gcgallo.github.io/BookEnds/](https://gcgallo.github.io/BookEnds/). Scroll through it to see the artwork in action (maybe I should automate the scrolling?)   
(note: this works best in chrome?)
